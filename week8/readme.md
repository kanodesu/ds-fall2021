* What will the visualization look like? Will it be interactive? If so, how?   
On the left, it will be a map of Manhattan. 
* How will the data need to be mapped to the visual elements?  
* For that mapping, what needs to be done to the data? Be specific and clear. Will it require filtering, aggregation, restructuring, and/or something else? How will this be done?  
* What is the default view (if any)?  
* What assumptions are you making about the user?
