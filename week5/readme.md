## Weekly Assignment 5



#### Assignment:

Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for your "Process Blog" data to be stored in this database table. Include all the content/data/variables from your "Process Blog" project that you believe to be relevant. Upload an image (`png` format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository. 

Using Word, populate three dummy NoSQL database entries that represent various plausible Process Blog entries (it's ok to use Lorem Ipsum for the text). 


#### Process:
I decided to make a blog to record my sleep quality with wake up time, sleep time and the total hours that I slept each day.
